#                     The model has a central position in a Play! application. It is the domain-specific 
#                     representation of the information on which the application operates.
                    
#                     Martin fowler defines it as:
                        
#                     Responsible for representing concepts of the business, information about the 
#                     business situation, and business rules. State that reflects the business situation 
#                     is controlled and used here, even though the technical details of storing it are 
#                     delegated to the infrastructure. This layer is the heart of business software.

#                     A Play! application follows the MVC architectural pattern as applied to the 
#                     architecture of the Web.
                    
#                     This pattern splits the application into separate layers: the Presentation 
#                     layer and the Model layer. The Presentation layer is further split into a 
#                     View and a Controller layer.
